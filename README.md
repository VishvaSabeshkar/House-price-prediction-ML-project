# House-price-prediction-ML-project
🏠 House Price Prediction in Python

This project is a complete Machine Learning pipeline for predicting house prices using real-world data. It follows the full data science process — from data exploration and preprocessing to model building and evaluation.

📊 Dataset

The dataset used is housing.csv, containing housing data such as location, number of rooms, income, and population.
Each row represents a block of houses and the target variable is the median_house_value.
